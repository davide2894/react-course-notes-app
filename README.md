# WHAT IS THIS
This project starts from a template initial setup of a notes app, provided by the course "Learn React for Free" on Scrimba.

Link: https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact

After the initial setup, I added the features requested by the instructor, which are the following:
1. Synch notes with localStorage
2. Add notes summary title
3. Move modified notes to the top of the list
4. Delete notes

This is all aimed to practice React programming concepts and core funcitonalities such as:
- components
- components hierarchy
- thinking in React
- props
- state management
- event handing
